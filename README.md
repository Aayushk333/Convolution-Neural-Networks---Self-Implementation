# Convolution-Neural-Networks---Self-Implementation

## Outline of the Project

We will be implementing the building blocks of a convolutional neural network! Each function we will implement will have detailed instructions.

- Convolution functions, including:
    - Zero Padding
    - Convolve window 
    - Convolution forward
- Pooling functions, including:
    - Pooling forward
    - Create mask 
    - Distribute value
